I have given comprehensive Unity for Artists workshops in Berlin, London, Cape Town and Amsterdam. This workshop is aimed for non-programmers and artists to start using Unity as their tool for creating real-time interactive and generative visuals.

<h3>Description</h3>

Taught by experienced VJ and media artist Fader, in this intimate hands-on workshop you will learn to create real-time visual environments on your computer. At the completion you will have a good understanding of the Unity workflow, code environment, and basic knowledge of C# programming.
